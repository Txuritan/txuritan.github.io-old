T-Taeh?.... <i>*sigh*</i> guess I am getting out MY way then" <i>*Nuro then reaches under her bed and pulls out a large metal container with a 5 digit tumbler lock. She opens the container and pulls out a large two-handed, single edge, longsword with a plethera of switches on the hilt. She flicks one of the switches and the sword begins tonleek a ethereal liquid energy from the edge of the blade. As she lifts it it leaves a ribbon of feint white light leaves a short trail of the swords path. Nuro swings the sword at the entirety of the door and the wall it is connected too, then swings it back around once more to cut upwards to the ceiling. Nuro then kicks the half inch steel door down and walks put into the hallway and over into the kitchen to make a sandwich*</i>

I have an idea, Kiki come here." <i>*She walks over and bends down so she can pick Taeh up, who whispers some words into her ears, she nods and goes over to do some thing to All*</i> "Okay so while you mess around with Alla, we got to choose which of you have to deal with me while I'm in this state."
