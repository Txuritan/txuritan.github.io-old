                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Kiki:</b> <i>*Sets Taeh down*</i> "Okay we need to figure out what to do with you, I have an idea but it's not a solution."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Taeh:</b> <i>*Mind speak*</i> "Well we will need to get a cure for Compound-347 or see if it will wear itself out and reverse me back, but we will record the effects of it on myself and others."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Kiki:</b> "Right, but we currently can't make a cure as we don't have the materials to do so. My only idea right now is to keep you as you are and document anything that happens." <i>*Hoping nothing bad, but it is Taeh so...*</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Taeh:</b> "So that plans out, the thing is I'm weak in this form," <i>*Nuro please don't realize that*</i> "so we have to find a host or something for me."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Kiki:</b> "Alla might agree, but I don't think she like being with you constantly. Nuro definitely won't agree, she can hardly stand you as it is, we don't need a weaker version of you with her and her tendences. That leaves me, you know I will agree, considering how I am and what I like."

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            <b>Kiki:</b> "Let's start then." <i>*She lays down on the laboratory table, places Taeh in between her legs, and moves the wool away from her vagina*</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Taeh:</b> "I'll be slow." <i>*He wiggles up to her moist entrance, that he will be home for the next few months, as he gets closer his body starts to make hormones to make entering her easier*</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Kiki:</b> "AHH! Taeh be careful, please." <i>*She moans as Taeh's slug-like body touches her folds, a shock goes through her body from the hormone infused goo that covered Taeh's body was injected into her*</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Taeh:</b> <i>*After making sure she's ready he slowly drags himself into her entrance using his suction cup to pull himself around* "Kiki I need you to relax your cervix, I remember what you wanted me to do but I'm going to have to go beyond it for awhile."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Kiki:</b> "I-EEHH think so-ooH, hang on-NN." <i>*She focuses on trying to relax her cervix to allow Taeh through into her uterus and feels a bit of pain as Taeh pushes into it and attempts to go through*</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Taeh:</b> "Okay I'm starting to go through." <i>*Kiki's cervix gives way and Taeh is able to squeeze his slug-like body through into her uterus*</i> "Does it hurt?"
