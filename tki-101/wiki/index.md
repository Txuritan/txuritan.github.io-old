TKI-101 or simply just TKI, is a series made up about a fictional universe where elves, dragons, humans, and animals dominating their own empires.

Tekaria is the name of the world at the beginning, it was created by the Three Guardians known as Ynnek, Relyt and Nai, who were eventually look upon to the mortal races. The guardians had servants known as dragons that soon became overpowered and enslaved the mortal races for over thousands of years. Since the dragons were worship as gods the mortals had no power over them at all. It wasnt unitl a human race interbred with the dragons becoming the Dragorans. They learn the strength and knowledge of a dragon and soon overthrew their dragon gods.

The description of Terkia conisist of the thirteen great landmasses. Dragorah is the home of the Dragorans which is a volcanic tundra like region, lava rivers flow and ash clouds block the sunlight. It is pretty lifeless there, the only things living there is the Dragorans. There are many cooler areas where the humans live, they are forest like and are much farther away from the Dragoran kingdoms.
