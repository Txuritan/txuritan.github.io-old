Victor Steele is one of the richest men in the galaxy. His fortune was gained through years of adventuring during the Thirteenth Great Planet Rush, almost two hundred years ago. Trillions of credits and a massive corporation grew up around him. To this day, Steele Industrial Technologies and Production, or Steele Tech, is one of the most respected names in its field. Unfortunately, the many mutations Victor underwent during his journeys wreaked havoc on his genome. Anti-agathic treatments have been decreasing in effectiveness as of late, and his doctors tell him that after two full centuries of life, he has a measly two decades left. This news is unwelcome, but he’s lived a rich, full life - fuller than most. With twenty years ahead of him, the suddenly old industrialite is looking toward finding a successor... or creating one.

That’s the solution. Victor can sire an heir or heiress to carry on his legacy and to ensure that the Steele name is honored throughout all of history. Perhaps he’ll even manage to raise them wisely enough to avoid the pitfalls he ran into as a youth. The next Planet Rush is a scant nineteen years ahead, so the timing is perfect. The United Galactic Confederacy has already sent out hundreds of warp gates, staggered so that they’ll all go online at the same time. These rushes are performed every century or two, expanding the reach of civilization light years into the stars, resulting in a galactic free-for-all. The concordant economic boom will be the perfect opportunity for Victor’s offspring to rise to greatness. They could become richer and more powerful than he ever was, and perhaps a better person as well.

The real question is, who should the lucky mother be? A lifelong accumulation of lovers has resulted in no shortage of potential mates eager for the opportunity to provide Victor an heir. Should he choose a pure human, like himself, or perhaps a dog-like Ausar, famed for their loyal and friendly dispositions, fluffy tails, and pointed ears? Or would something else be a better choice? Decisions, decisions...

--

The kaithrit are a cat-like race with two prehensile, feline tails. They are known for their feminine appearances and exotic colorations, so any child of Victor and kaithrit would have more possible hair colors, a prettier face than normal, and two tails. Also, if the child is a male, it’ll have a soft-spined, cat-like penis.

Is this the race Victor chooses?

Kaithrit

--

Yes, kaithrit would be the best choice. A smile breaks across Victor’s face as he recalls some very... useful traits that might be beneficial to a soon-to-be galactic explorer.

He approaches the lady in question, and of course, she agrees. The sex is as mindblowing as anyone could want from a lover who’s about to have her child be the heir to an intergalactic megacorp, and with all the Tamani-brand fertility enhancers they both took, pregnancy is assured. The only thing left to do is for the two lovebirds to go to Victor’s private clinic and make sure that only the best genes take hold in his future heir. He holds hands with his chosen partner, a knowing grin on both their faces as the skycar takes them to their destination. She doesn’t know about his pending mortality. Victor doesn’t want to spoil the mood.

Victor’s doctor sits him down while his chosen wife is taken to the medbay, and he tucks his holo-glasses into his coat pocket as he starts to grill Victor on the attributes he’d like the embryo to have, beginning with the sex. Should his heir be male or female, and what should the unborn child be named?

Maerie

Female

--

The doctor asks “So, you’re going to have a female child, then? Very well. How tall should she grow up to be? Please, give it in Imperial inches.”

Victor raises an eyebrow and quips, “Seriously? Inches? What is this, the 20th century?”

“Victor, I’ve known you for eighty years. We both know you’re a sucker for the classics. Don’t pretend you don’t use that archaic system just to screw with your acquaintances.” The doctor smiles and continues, “Now, the height?”

68.00000004

--

Marking his pad, he chuckles and clears his throat. The doctor asks, “How thickset should she be? Please note that I’m not referring to weight so much as the broadness of their overall frame - hips and shoulders, you know.”

Husky

--

“Great,” he says absently, entering the information with his stylus. “I thought of asking for her adult weight in pounds, but knowing you, you would have taken me seriously. Obviously, your kitchen staff will be the ones who control that.” He clears his throat, sombering slightly. “How about hair color? We could do black, like yours was, or any of the other natural colors pretty easily.”

Black

--

“I thought you’d choose black, boss. How about eye color? Got anything in mind?” The doctor glances up from his tablet and awaits Victor’s response.

Green

--

“Great. How about skin pigmentation?”

Tan

--

“Breasts?”

B

--

“All right, I can specialize the vagina for capacity, extra lubrication, both, or neither. If we do both, the effects won’t be as pronounced as focusing on a single choice. I know that’s probably not the first thing you want to think about as a dad, but if the kid is gonna be taking after you, it’d be wise to tweak up at least one of those.” The doctor looks at Victor expectantly.

Both

--

“Great!” Your personal physician notes your choice and says, “This is one of the tougher choices future parents have to make. We can work some tweaks into your successor’s genome that’ll give them a bit of a gift, if you know what I mean - even beyond the choices you’ve made so far. The downside is that we can only safely insert one of these options into your child’s genome.”

“I’ll give you the quick rundown of all the choices. ‘Virile’ increases the quality of sperm produced by your offspring, even if she’s a girl that splices on a dick later. ‘Potent’ is similar to virile, but it impacts the quantity produced, rather than quality. This one seems to be pretty popular among those who can afford these kinds of modifications. ‘Elasticity’ allows for bigger insertions with less chance of, uh... stretching.”

The doctor coughs a bit nervously. “‘Fertility’ enhances the chances of becoming pregnant. ‘Milky’ causes lactation to be more easily induced and much harder to stop. ‘Incubator’... well, it makes pregnancies a little faster. ‘Hung’ would enlarge the size of male organs and cause them be more receptive to future splices. Conversely, ‘mini’ would, uh, cause masculine organs to tend towards smallness - as the name implies.”

Victor sighs as the doctor drones on, knowing that these could be important but a little tired of the total volume of the information.

“‘Bulgy’ would cause an increase in the size of any testes as well as increased receptiveness to gonad enhancement. ‘Extra Ardor’ will cause an increase in sex drive after maturity. I bet your parents gave you that, huh? ‘Ice Cold’ would be the opposite, reducing natural sex drive. It doesn’t have any effect on aphrodisiacs or receptiveness to touch, however.” The doctor touches his fingers as if counting and purses his lips, “Huh, I guess that’s all of them. What’ll it be?”

Milky

--

“Grrrreat,” the doctor muses as he checks your selection. “Just one more thing: I can slip in affinity for a certain attribute. These are all pretty self explanatory, so I won’t have to bore you overmuch. Suffice to say, your daughter will be able to increase the chosen attribute more easily. We can do physique, reflexes, aim, intelligence, or willpower. Personally, I recommend intelligence.”

These ability scores are capped at five to start, though certain things like current level, starting race, cybernetic enhancements, and specific mutations can increase the maximum.

Physique is a measurement of a character’s strength and endurance. Its primary usage to land melee strikes and increase the damage of said strikes.

Reflexes are a measurement of piloting aptitude, but they also come in handy when having to avoid a surprise attack or trap.

Aim is a representation of how well one can aim both hand-held and ship-board ranged weaponry.

Intelligence increases the effectiveness of technology-based attacks, primarily those used by tech specialists. It is also useful any time one has to deal with sophisticated machinery.

Willpower is used to counter sexual urges and addictions, resist psionics, and strengthen one’s own psionics, should a person of human descent somehow gain mind powers.

Libido, while not an option the doc is giving, deals with how fast lust increases over time and susceptible to incidental lusts and perversions one is. It is not capped by level and scales from 1 to 100.

Reflexes

--

Some time later...
Maerie was born without complications, but now Victor is faced with a new quandary. Just how is he going to raise his potential successor? If he pampers her, she’ll have a head start on life, but will likely be lacking in willpower. If Victor pushes her into athletics, she’ll likely develop her physical skills over her mental ones. Of course, the father could push his progeny towards being a bit of a bookworm, as knowledge is power, but she’d wind up physically weaker. An austere upbringing would result in higher willpower but a little less of a financial, helping hand. The alternative to those options would be a balanced upbringing that favors nothing in particular.

Bookworm

--

You are Maerie now, but the question remains, what kind of person will you be?

(This choice will affect how your character reacts to the challenges and situations she finds herself in. Ultimately choice will still remain with you, the player, but the way Maerie goes through those choices may vary with personality.)

Mischievous

--

You’re all grown up and finished with your schooling. Dad pushed you hard, which makes sense. He accomplished a lot and wants you to follow in his footsteps, but for whatever reason, he insisted you take on an occupation, and an odd one at that.

Smuggler

--

Your dad’s health had been declining throughout your years of education, but you never really worried too much about it. He was super rich, able to afford his own private doctors, so the thought that one day he could disappear never entered your mind. When you started your career, he was there to see you off, smiling gregariously, but your job made it difficult to stay in touch. Most communications were done via written messages, until even those became scarce. You had assumed it to be a consequence of your different schedules and busy work lives, then...

The news of his death arrived in a brief missive, containing an invitation to a funeral as well as a travel voucher to get you there. You quit your job on the spot. The way Dad talked, you’re sure he would have wanted you to take over the family business. What could have killed him? He always seemed so big and imposing. Even when his back was bent by age, he still had vital energy about him, seeming as busy as a man a tenth of his age. You don’t know why anti-agathic treatments stopped working on him. Worse, he aged far more rapidly than he should have, losing his youth in a short decade.

You shake your head to chase away the unwelcome thoughts and focus on packing. The trip is boring, leaving you with nothing to think about except life without your father and the uncertain future ahead. Hopefully the old man was lucky enough to go out in a dignified way.

Your transport pulls up to Tavros Station, where the service is being held. Adjusting your finest clothes, you walk through the airlock and up some old-fashioned steps towards the theater Dad’s money bought him, trying to keep your eyes clear as you breeze past a surprisingly low amount of paparazzi. They must have gotten decent security this time.

You push open the doors and step inside...

--

The funeral is closed casket with no viewing, which is expected given the shape Dad was in the last time you saw him. His body was riddled with the lines of age and marked with liver spots and pre-cancerous lumps, and he didn’t want to be remembered that way. Thankfully, the ceremony is swift and fairly small. There are only family and friends here, though you wager a large amount of the ‘family’ is distant relations hoping to catch some of the inheritance.

Much of the wake passes in a daze, with you swarmed by distant relations and well wishers, forced to shake hands and share hugs with people you don’t know while they offer barely-felt, useless platitudes that do nothing to assuage your loss.

You’re on your way over to your father’s real friends, people you’ve actually seen around his mansion growing up, when his lawyer intercepts you and pulls you aside.

“Come, we must talk...”

--

You follow the lawyer’s brisk stride with a bit of difficulty. He’s a samarin; long-limbed, yellow-skinned, and not overly inclined to slow his walk for your comfort. He also talks the entire way.

“Your father’s will was a bit unconventional. He’s lucky my firm has had such wonderful dealings with him over the years, or I would not have been willing to undertake such a... complicated executorship.”

You shrug, figuring your dad had a lot of wealth to distribute.

The lawyer’s quills bristle at your noncommittal response, but he carries on. “Regardless of the headache my best client’s death has caused me, I’m pleased to officiate this bit of business. Victor spoke rather highly of you, and he didn’t say that about just anyone, I assure you.”

The lawyer turns to regard you with a smile as he waits for you to catch up, clapping you on the back when you’re in reach. “My name is Maki. We’ve never been formally introduced, I suppose.” He extends a coarse, dry hand and you shake it, commenting that he already has your name. He continues, “To be brief, your dad rented out most of the hangars on this station for you. He also had a state of the art, xeno-compatible daycare facility built here to house any future offspring you create. I have to give him credit, he planned ahead. Construction has been going on here for the past four years at his behest.”

Grinning at your surprise, the tawny alien opens a door to the side and steps inside, still talking. “Victor knew he’d be dying around this time since before your birth. I suppose he didn’t want the knowledge weighing over you. Medical science is amazing, but your father underwent so many mutations in his life that he was barely considered human by the time he finished carving out his fortune. Sure, he looked fine when he came home, but he only managed that by taking on the most humanesque mutations from the various races he encountered. I shudder to imagine how long that took him, or how expensive it was to purchase specific splices.”

Well, that explains the melancholy tone some of his missives took whenever you had been making plans to visit him in the future. A plain metal chair creaks as the lawyer takes his seat behind a similarly austere desk, smoothing his quills into a semblance of slicked-back hair. He opens a drawer and drops two items on the table: a simple injector and a rectangular, leather-wrapped object. The injector is filled with a silvery, viscous fluid. The other object has the leather wrapped around one side of it, leaving polished metal sides exposed.

“Take them, they’re yours. Both custom work. Both very, very powerful pieces of technology.”

You heft the tablet, wondering how it could be that expensive, even with the Earth-leather binding and quality materials used in its construction. Once you pull back the cover, you expose a high resolution tablet running a custom operating system.

“Greetings, Maerie. I am the Codex. You may address me as Codex. I am a simple virtual intelligence, or V.I. in common parlance, programmed to assist you in cataloging new life, resources, and technologies. I am equipped with long-range extranet transmitters and receivers, allowing for communication and data access in most locations. There is a short-range life sensor embedded in me that allows me to warn you of impending danger. Upon detecting a new species, I will collate all extranet-available data on the species for you to peruse within a minute or two. I have haptic feedback on my screen and do accept voice commands, Mistress Maerie.”

You fold the sophisticated computer’s cover closed and find that its supple case comes complete with a connector that allows it to be easily hung from a belt. Snapping it on, you look closer at the injector and ask, “So what’s this then?”

The lawyer steeples his fingers and says, “Microsurgeon immune boosters. Top of the line. Your dad will tell you more.” He gestures towards a second door set into the wall beside you. “Go on through.”

You take the injector and open the door, unsure just how much weirder this can get...

--

The next room is empty, save for a comfy looking, leather recliner. You actually recognize it as one of your father’s favorites. The arm rests are only a little more worn than you remember. A holo projector protrudes from the ceiling, aimed at the empty space in front of the chair. With nothing else to do, you seat yourself. The projector kicks on and your Dad’s face appears.

“Hey there, princess. If you’re seeing this, then my wrinkled old ass has finally kicked the bucket. I hope you aren’t too torn up over it; I’ve lived a long full life, longer than most people are lucky enough to live. Do me a favor and knock back a whiskey for me after this,” the phantom image of your father says. A hand clips in front of his face as he rubs at his age-silvered goatee. “Unfortunately, while I am seeing that your mother is taken care of, I’m not just handing the company over to you. Not yet, anyway.”

You glance down at the Codex and the vial in your hand. What did the old coot plan for you?

“I know you’ve probably been too busy to keep up on the news, with the work I’ve pushed you into, but the fourteenth planet rush ought to be starting about now.” A note appears over the recording, indicating the planet rush started almost two months ago, though most gates have only started going online in the past few weeks. “I have to make sure you’ve grown into a woman worthy of running the business, Maerie, so I’m putting you through what I went through, after a fashion. If you want to take over the company, you’re going on the planet rush!”

Huh. Well, you suppose the careers he pushed you towards make a bit more sense in light of that. Your father made his fortune during the thirteenth planet rush, and he obviously intends for you to prove your mettle in the same way.

“Maki should have given you the Codex and immune boosters by now. I’m sure the V.I. inside it has already explained what it can do for you, but to summarize: it’s going to be your best friend. You can use it to stake claims on untapped minerals and resources that the boys back home will run through the legal system. We’ll deliver you a stipend on each usable discovery.”

Victor coughs repeatedly, holding a rag up in front of himself that darkens with what you assume to be flecks of blood in the monochromatic recording. You’d think he could have sprung for a color hologram. His coughs clear up and he continues, “Sorry, health isn’t what it used to be.” He laughs after that, realizing that for you, he’s dead. “Anyhow, the immune boosters. Those micro-scale bots will reproduce in your body and safeguard it from some of the worst the universe can throw at you. They aren’t perfect, and more benign infections might slip through, but they’ll keep you from catching rot lung from a Trinerian. A word of caution: they’ll help you digest things that would normally be impossible for a human, but they’ll splice you to do it. You eat the wrong native foods, and you’ll wind up looking like a native. You might even start to feel like one, mentally. I’m told it’s like forced, convergent evolution.”

You turn the microsurgeon immune boosters over in your hand, debating whether to use them.

“This recording is set up to repeat until you do it, Maerie.”

Sighing, you press the injector port to the inside of your arm.

“This recording is set up to rep-”

The injector hisses as it pricks your skin, pouring its payload into your veins. There’s a bit of burning pain, but nothing as bad as the time you dropped your cargo on your foot, breaking more than a few toes in the process. You grow a little flushed for a moment as the tiny machines settle into you. It passes swiftly. All things considered, you feel... the same.

“Atta girl. I had something like that made for me after a particularly rough infection, though it wound up mutating me from exotic species’ sexual fluids as well.”

A fucking horndog until the end. Of course.

The recording smiles wistfully for a moment before resuming, “I suppose that might have contributed to my demise, but damn, it was worth it. You’ll see for yourself once you get out there.”

Sure, whatever.

“I’ve arranged to have a few dozen probes sent through the gates once they open. Each one is military grade hardened and keyed to only open for one of our family, so don’t lose too much of yourself. They all have clues pointing towards other probes secreted inside them, except for one. One has my personal, encrypted key. With that, you can open my deposit box in the bank I own on this station and take control of my company,” Even projected through the soulless holoprojector, your dad’s spirit shines through his tear-misted eyes. “I’m sure you’ll make me proud out there.”

The projection of your father tilts its head, gesturing towards another door behind it. “Through the door behind, you’ll find a hangar with the ship I started my journey on, repaired to usable condition and outfitted with standard, modernized technology. It’s a good starting point, but you should see if you can jump up to something better, particularly if you pick up the number of crewmates I did. That little junker can only hold a few people.”

You rise to progress, but Dad keeps talking. “One more thing.... there’s a Galotian in the next room, right next to the ship’s key. If you want to do this, you’ve gotta subdue her. Galotians are voracious protein hunters, but they’re not truly dangerous. She’s still a tough little foe, though. I’ve set up some recordings to assist you in learning how to handle creatures like this during your adventures.” Dad winks. “Good luck!”

--

You open the doorway and step through a little hesitantly, your hands on your hold-out pistol and knife in case you need them. Visible light slowly increases as the systems dial up in response to your presence, illuminating an amorphous green blob that huddles in the corner. The semi-transparent, emerald mass bulges out at the base and turns to regard you. You aren’t sure how you can make such an assessment when it has no visible face or eyes, but it definitely seems to be reacting to you and you alone. Lurching violently, a bubbling mass erupts from the top of it, sparkling as it builds higher and higher, the cylindrical distention reforming into a more familiar, humanoid shape.

Dense insets reveal themselves to be eyes. Darker hued bulges resolve into shapely lips. Excess material drapes down the back of the growing creature into a mane of unkempt, wild hair. The alien makes a sound that resembles a sigh of relief as arms separate from the sides of what must be its torso, while strings of fluid hang between the newborn appendages and the rest of her, reminding you just how gooey this thing is. Finally, the front of the chest bulges out into a pair of pert breasts. At least, they seemed that way at first. More and more liquid flows from seemingly endless reservoirs inside the thing, bloating the improvised mammaries bigger, fuller, and rounder with each passing second. The goo-girl doesn’t stop them until they obscure the bulk of her torso, reminding you of some of the racier porn-stars out there on the extranet.

With her bust jiggling and wobbling in such a titanic manner that you feel it might separate from her chest, the gelatinous gal runs her hands over and through the new, bulgy boobs, giggling as your eyes follow her motions. She chirps, “Hiya! You look like you taste pretty good! I think I’ll drain you dry...”

She lurches forward, and for a second, you fear you’ll be engulfed before you can react. A blue flash interrupts her pell-mell undulations, and your Dad’s face appears between you, suspended in the air. He explains, “Celise here is a fairly simple girl with simple needs. Unfortunately, she doesn’t respect anyone until she feels they’ve earned it. You’re going to have to fight her if you want to get the keys to your new ship.”

Damnit, Dad!

It’s a fight!

--

You’re fighting Celise.
A three foot high, oblong ball of goo jiggles and wobbles across from you, its surface somehow holding back the liquid weight inside even though it appears no more solid than the rest of it. Atop the mound of viridian goop is the torso of a ultrapornstar goddess. Pendulous breasts hang from the front of her glittering chest, obscuring everything above her navel with gooey boob. Her eyes glitter with a predatory mirth, slightly darker in hue than the rest of her, a color matched by her plump, wet-looking lips. You need to defeat her if you ever want to lay claim to Dad’s fortune and make him proud!
Celise’s puddling, super-stretchy cunt is practically soaked with her lustful secretions.

Victor instructs, “Try and strike her, Maerie. Use a melee attack.”

Attack

--

Your attack sinks into the goo, the wound vanishing almost instantly as her surface recloses.

Well, that didn’t work! She seems completely immune to normal physical attacks.

“Hehe, that tickles!” Celise giggles, “Are you sure you want to listen to that old fuddy duddy instead of letting me plunge into your pink, virginal, human vagina?” She pushes her finger into the semipermeable membrane around her breast, allowing you to hear the lewd, sucking noises her body makes around her digit as you watch. “It’ll feeeel gooood!”

--

You need to defeat her if you ever want to lay claim to Dad’s fortune and make him proud!
Celise’s incredibly elastic, gooey gash is practically soaked with her lustful secretions.

“Some foes are more vulnerable to ranged attacks than melee attacks or vice versa. Why don’t you try using your gun? Don’t worry, it won’t kill her.” Victor suggests.

Shoot

--

The goo twists a portion of its body out of the way of the attack, moving in a way that would be fatal for any vertebrate.

The goo-girl appears impervious to everything you can throw at her! Just how did Dad expect you to handle something like this?

Celise leans down to put her palms flat on the ground, her breasts squishing out around the sides of her arms, actually merging partway into her elbows as she begins to crawl toward you, wiggling her suddenly visible rump and hips at you, now revealed by her altered posture. “I’m gonna suck all the yummiest juices out of you!” Her lips plump bigger after the declaration, almost forcefully reminding you how good they would feel on your sweltering vagina.

Celise’s green, incredibly elastic, terran cunt is practically soaked with her lustful secretions.

“Didn’t work, did it? Celise’s race does pretty well against kinetic damage. Thermal weapons would work, but you don’t have any of those. You’ve still got one more weapon that galotians can’t handle - sexual allure. They’re something of a sexual predator, but their libidos are so high that teasing them back often turns them on to the point where they masturbate into a puddle of quivering sex.” Victor chuckles. “Go ahead, try teasing her. Fighting aliens is about using the right types of attacks in the right situations.”

Tease

--

You remove your dress clothes and plain bra with ease to free the perfectly rounded, perky breasts. You run your hands across the tan skin to thumb at your nipples and grace your target with a lascivious look before putting the girls away a little regretfully.

Whoah, now that’s a reaction! Celise whimpers and starts to vigorously fist herself again and again, not even bothering to make sure her hand goes between her legs. Wherever she shoves her balled fist into, sensitive lips form around it, suckling and oozing with lust around her fast-pumping arm.

Victory

--

Celise is too turned on to fight.

Celise groans, “Come on, fuck me! Please? Don’t just... leave me like this! I need your juiiiiice!” The last word comes out as a high-pitched, nearly orgasmic whine. Her masturbation gets faster and more lewd with every passing second.

Victor’s hologram faces you and explains, “If you’re seeing this, you learned how to disable Celise. Good work. The key is on the shelf next to the exit.” He sighs and continues, “Most things you run into won’t be nearly as easy to deal with. You’ll want to make sure to master the skills of your vocation and use them to the best of your ability. As you develop your abilities, you’ll find that many of them can be chained together to be more effective. Make sure you do that, or you’ll have a hard time beating some of the galaxy’s worst.”

You put away your weapons and go to grab your key when a barely cohesive hand wraps around your foot. There isn’t enough force behind it to immobilize you, but it does catch your attention. Celise is looking up at you with pleading eyes that would make an Earth puppy proud.

“If you give Celise what she wants now, you’ll probably earn her loyalty. That choice is up to you; I can’t make it for you. Galotians are a fiercely loyal people once they choose to follow someone, and though she has few marketable skills, it might be good to have a companion out there in the void. Whatever you choose, I’m sure you’ll do me proud.” Victor smiles dryly. “After all, I bet my legacy on it.”

The recording winks off.

What do you do with Celise? Ignore her, or feed her and take her on your crew?

Feed Celise

--

Smiling a little lustily, you strip out of your gear and toss it up on the shelf, next to the key. Celise smiles beatifically up at you, her eyes practically humping your skin as you reveal yourself. When your terran vagina is exposed, she visibly licks her lips and ceases her masturbation, using her jade secretions to oil her heavy tits, teasing tiny nubs that bloom into big, suckable nipples in a matter of moments. You sensually swivel your hips and ask, “So, is this your first time or what?”

The glittering, hungry slut composes herself enough to surge towards you, ignoring your question completely. Instead, she rolls at you like a wave, if a wave could be capped with bloating bimbo lips and a slithering tongue that could put a snake to shame. You let her crash into you, knowing that she doesn’t pose any real threat at this point, and simply enjoy the sensation of her warm body sliding around your legs. In a way, it’s like slipping into a nice bath, only the bath is a bit thicker and strokes you everywhere, like an army of phantasmal tongues, all worshipping you at once.

The real tongue comes into contact with your constricting twat a moment before two plush pillows compress against your mons, smothering your labia in sloppy-wet kisses. The tongue slithers over the folded flesh, drawing gasps and moans from you as your pussy goes ten kinds of juicy. Your clitty engorges and peeks out from its hood in response, hard and sensitive against the slippery, gooey mouth. You grab hold of the shelf to try remain upright, briefly fearing that you’ll fall inside her and drown as the pleasure takes you, but the way Celise’s eyes look up at you while she tends to your pink, narrow, human vagina leaves no doubt in your mind: she’d never let that happen. She’s far too busy worshipping you orally, sucking down your juices even as hers turn your exterior genitalia into a swampy, green mess.

You give up your grip even as your legs give out, lewdly splaying wide inside their gelatinous prisons. Instead, your hands secure themselves on the back of Celise’s head, pushing her harder and more urgently into your tight, human vagina. A muffled cry of excitement vibrates through your vulvae as the goo-girl finds herself between a rock-hard grip and a wet place. Her tongue wriggles and writhes unguided at first, then it draws back, suddenly controlled. As you hump the moist fuck-pillows perched on your oozing quim, the wiggling probe pierces through your sensitive curtains, sliding past your hymen without tearing it and thickening on the other side. The tendril rolls in wet little circles inside you, smashing into one nerve-cluster after another, relentlessly searching for your G-spot.

Long pseudopods appear out of the insubstantial mass behind Celise’s head and arch towards your nipples. They smack wetly against your tits as they attach and begin to tug. They’re thin enough that they appear as transparent, emerald stalks that trickle similarly colored lubricants around the edges of your areolae. Rhythmic suckles slowly pull on you, causing your buds to engorge. You’re in ecstasy, tended to above and below by soft, forgiving slickness.

A mouth forms on Celise’s shoulder while she guzzles your secretions, asking, “How am I doing?”

Your only reaction is to grind your ample hips more forcefully into her face, whimpering as your virgin, human fuck-hole begins to spasm. You’re so very close to orgasm that it’s getting hard to control your movements. You jerk and shake whenever Celise’s tongue finds your G-spot, something she does with increasing regularity, and you’re glad to be supported by her as she pushes and rubs against it, increasing the pressure.

Mind-numbing explosions of bliss erupt from the cunt-shattering orgasm that wracks your body; you arch your back so violently that you almost crack your head on the shelf above. Luckily, Celise’s arms pop out to grab you around the waist, steadying your lusty thrashing. She gleefully swallows, her throat bobbing as she drinks down your juices. A reverse imprint of your pussy forms on her lips, caressing your entire mound with perfect green synchronicity while her tongue swells wider inside you. As it expands, there’s a sudden shift inside you along with the sensation of something draining away, almost like she’s turned her busy pseudopod into a quim-sucking straw, ensuring that her feeding continues uninterrupted while you’re brought to new heights of climax. The pleasure continues with no end in sight. Your genitals ache, tender after an eternity of stimulation. Whenever you think relief is at hand, the inverse hood around the tip of your clit vibrates and sets you off in a blaze of fresh orgasm all over again.

By the time you piece your consciousness back together, you find yourself babbling incoherently in the midst of a continuous, mind-shattering orgasm. Once Celise has her fill, you’re an incoherent mess. Aftershocks of pleasure quake through your still-twitching body as she detaches. She slowly separates from you, shuddering a little bit herself as you’re pulled out of her gooey embrace. The sucking holes holding your legs close up, but not before you get a glimpse of vaginal lips topped with soaked nubs. This goo-girl was fucking herself on your legs as she ate you out! The whole of your lower body is soaked and dripping with her jade moisture, particularly your feet. Your nice butt touches the cold, metal floor as she daintily wipes her mouth on the back of a juicy palm, allowing you a moment to recover..

“That was great, and your cunny was super tasty, too! Can I come on your ship? Like Vik said, I’m super thankful you stopped to feed me!” Celes bubbles.

Despite your exhaustion, you manage to give her a stern look.

“I promise not to try and force myself on you or nothing! ‘Sides, you know just how to make me melt anyhow! I can get by on water and protein paste, but if a mean ol’ alien ever gets you all wet and juicy...” Celise nibbles on her lower lip, and with every tiny bite, it grows puffier and poutier, looking softer by the minute. “...I’ll be the perfect little lesbian, girlspunk-dump. Or, if you grow a dick I’ll be totally happy to suck on that,” she adds, nodding enthusiastically. “You’ll be yummy either way!”

Do you take Celise on as your first crew member?

Take Her

--

“Why not? If nothing else, I guess I can use you as a super-soft beanbag chair, when we aren’t fucking.”

Celise jiggles jubilantly, the accumulated mass of goo below her waist churning with excitement as she applauds. She gulps in a huge breath of air, ballooning herself comically before exhaling it in a quiet “Yayyyy...” You glance at her curiously, and she shyly covers her mouth, whispering, “Sorry.”

Whatever, it’s time to get this show on the road! You grab the digikey off the shelf and step through the door.

--

A sprawling, brightly lit hangar greets your eyes, empty save for a single ship near the back. Your gaze is pulled away from the distant craft by the sheer size of the enclosure. A hangar like this must have cost your father a veritable fortune to buy out - not much considering how wealthy he was, but no insignificant chunk of change. Magnetically-bounded plasma shields hold in the atmosphere while remaining transparent enough for you to view the nearby warp gate and inky blackness beyond. Perhaps the only thing this place couldn’t hold would be a capital ship, but a number of moorings with connective umbilicals stand by to tether one outside in that extreme scenario.

You chuckle and wonder if you’ll ever need anything that grandiose while you turn your attention back to the light craft in the corner, currently surrounded by techs. Breezing up to them, you get your first good look at your inheritance; in short, it’s a bit of a junker. The hull plating is ancient and rusted in a dozen places where the paint has long since rotted off. Whole pieces of it are still on the floor, being cut into with plasma torches to replace dead tech, and the design of it is a century out of date. You bite back your sigh before it leaves your mouth, noting the newly installed engines and computer systems. Still, new engines don’t make it look any less like a elderly rim-jockey’s heap.

“Hello there! You must be the young Captain Steele! A pleasure to meet you,” one of the technicians says once he spots you. “Sorry the ship is in such rough shape. Towing it all the way out here took a little longer than anticipated, so we got a late start. We’re pulling a double shift to get it all done by tonight. Just give us a little more time, maybe get a bite to eat and a place to stay ‘til morning. She’ll look a hundred times better once we finish up, I promise.”

You shake the hangar tech’s hand and nod to him, understanding the enormity of the project before them. The nametag on his jumper lists him as ‘Zeke’. He nods and jovially quips, “Yah, my name’s Zeke, or Z if you really wanna get short with it. Whatever you bring in here, I’ll keep maintained or fix up. Cleaning up other folks’ messes is kinda my business.” Zeke waves you off. “Go on, get something to eat. I’m sure you had a shitty day and don’t wanna spend the rest of it hanging around us while we put this back together.”

A clearly marked exit portal dilates as you approach, and you step out into the station’s main thoroughfare. It’s surprisingly quiet and devoid of the shops you’d expect to see. The only place with any grub looks to be an “Anon’s Bar”, though it boasts mention of rooms for rent as well.

You head on in...

--

Heady alcoholic scents combine with drug-laced smoke and salty food to give this place the unquestionable aroma of a seedy bar. Three-breasted waitresses balancing trays full of drinks one-handed sashay around in short skirts and sheer tops, their gait made awkward by their three legs and small feet. One of them notices you and asks, “A drink for you, hun?”

After a moment, you decide to order a whiskey. Regardless of your personal feelings, Dad asked you to knock one back for him. You may as well humor the dead codger, even if he did make acquiring your inheritance a trial and a half. At that point, your belly rumbles, and you realize that you haven’t had anything to eat since this morning.

“How about I bring out some hot buns with that for you to munch on. You can look over the menu while you snack.” She doesn’t wait around for an answer, moving off to drop a single drink off at a nearby table on her way to the kitchen. The drink is scooped up by a figure obscured by the bar’s dusky atmosphere. It’s difficult to make out much about... the humanoid shape, but its gender and features elude you. There’s nothing else to do, so you ponder the nearby person... just what sex are they?

Female

--

She’s female, surely. Just as you make that conclusion, she turns and spots you. You lean back and try to make yourself look as inconspicuous as a bored, leering stranger can, but it must not work out too well. The silhouette gets up and snatches her drink, walking towards you with a slow, overly confident gait that betrays its owner’s nimbleness. You ball your fists and hope that you’re not going to get in a fight on a day like today.

Luckily, the figure resolves into someone more familiar: Jill Steele, obviously on station for the same reason as you. Jill is your cousin, though in this case, familiarity breeds no affection. Her father is Maximillian Steele, your Dad’s brother and all around conniving bastard. Uncle Max made his fortune by following your father and filing time-shifted, forged claims on as many of your father’s finds as he could. The worst part of it is that some of the claims actually held up in court, allowing him to make out nearly as well as Dad with a fraction of the risk.

Jill pulls you from your thoughts with a snide greeting, “Hello, cousin.” The last part is enunciated in a sneer. Perhaps she was brought up with a similar tale, demonizing your father. You wouldn’t put it past Uncle Max.

“Hail, Jill,” you say with less humor than you usually bring to a conversation, “What brings you to my table?”

Jill smirks and takes a swig of her drink. “I just thought I’d let you know that Uncle Vic made a huge mistake. No, a gigantic one.” She laughs and continues, “The best part is that neither of you even know it! Let me elucidate for you, simple cousin.” Jill produces a simple touch tablet from her pocket and a tiny, chit-sized disk.

“This is a pretty standard handheld computer, but this,” she says holding the miniature device aloft, “is a sophisticated tracking and eavesdropping device - just like the one in your pocket.”

No.... You reach into your pocket and turn it out, catching an identical device when it falls into your hand. You immediately drop it on the floor and crush it underfoot, but that merely earns a derisive snort from your unfriendly dinner companion.

“The data was already transmitted. I know everything, Maerie. Best of all, I’m part of the family, so your father’s precious gene-locked probes will handily divulge their secrets to me. Jill gives an ingratiating smile. “My ship is already good to go, but I think I’d rather depart on a good night’s rest. Besides, why should I need to rush when your clunker is in pieces all over your hangar? Good luck, cuz.”

Jill swaggers off with her drink and her spy machines, leaving you to brood on your thoughts while your order arrives. It tastes bitter in your mouth after such a betrayal, but you swear to yourself that the punk won’t take over Dad’s company. Even the outrageous bustiness of your server won’t cheer you up at this point, nor will the surprisingly delicious wings.

You burp as fatigue sets in and make off to secure quarters for the evening. Tomorrow is going to be a big day, and you intend to hit the galactic rim hard.

Tomorrow, you join the Planet Rush.

--

When you rise, the Codex beeps and says, “Message received.” You flip it open to read the missive, instead getting blasted with your snotty cousin’s voice as she says, “Good morning sleepyhead. I just wanted to let you know that I left not long after you went to bed. My ship does have luxurious sleeping quarters for ten, after all. Ta ta!”

“Message complete,” the codex blithely states.

You hastily don your gear and scramble over to the hangar, hoping it has a replicator capable of making something approximating a decent breakfast. The techs are gone, probably sleeping after a full night’s work. The ship looks completely different all finished up. It’s been painted bright red with silvery stripes. Looking at it again, you realize that you recognize this from some of your father’s holo-pics, at least the ones he’d let you see. This is the same ship that he took out on the Thirteenth Planet Rush, almost two centuries ago.

(Ship Acquired: Casstech Z14)

--

A sprawling, brightly lit hangar greets your eyes, empty save for a single ship near the back. Your gaze is pulled away from the distant craft by the sheer size of the enclosure. A hangar like this must have cost your father a veritable fortune to buy out - not much considering how wealthy he was, but no insignificant chunk of change. Magnetically-bounded plasma shields hold in the atmosphere while remaining transparent enough for you to view the nearby warp gate and inky blackness beyond. Perhaps the only thing this place couldn’t hold would be a capital ship, but a number of moorings with connective umbilicals stand by to tether one outside in that extreme scenario.

You spot a blond, half-ausar technician standing next to your ship, looking down at a datapad.

Tech

--

Feeling a bit curious, you walk up to chat to him. When you get close, his brown canine ears perk and he looks up with a brilliant smile. His sandy tail is swishing back and forth.

“Hi there, Captain Steele! Nice ship you’ve got here,” the technician cheerfully tells you. He stretches out a hand and you shake it. “I’m Vahn, one of the ground crew assigned to your ship.”

You’ve never heard anyone call your ship ‘nice’. Really, it’s an old clunker. You ask him why he thinks it’s so amazing.

“W-well, I guess it’s not from a pilot’s perspective. But for me, your old Casstech Z14 is like a big puzzlebox, always breaking down and a real brain-teaser to fix. Pretty obvious why I became a mechanic, right? It’s really challenging to keep your old clunker going. Sometimes it even stumps the boss, and that’s saying something!”

He deactivates and tucks the pad away, turning his full attention to you. “...So, was there something you want, or just checking up on your ship? Don’t worry, the repair costs are footed by Steele Industries - anything extra, though, and we’d have to charge.”

Talk

--

What would you like to talk to Vahn about?

Starships

--

You ask Vahn how he ended up working on starships, specifically yours.

“Only the best technicians for Maerie Steele, I guess?” He playfully grins and slides his hands in his jump suit pockets. “... I love working on ships and Steele Tech has a lot of them. I like yours the most, though, because it’s an exploratory vessel.”

When you ask why that’s important, Vahn’s eyes come alive with excitement. “Oh, what isn’t to love? I’m working on a ship that’s going where nobody’s ever gone before! You’re going to be roughing it through alien skies, landing on alien worlds - all in the ship I’ve worked on!”

“Without a top notch vessel, even the greatest galactic rusher is stuck twiddling their thumbs in a docking bay. Not too different from what you’re doing now, right?” He teasingly winks, bushy tail swishing. “... All my sweat and effort goes into your engines, shields, guns, life support... pretty cool, right?”

--

What would you like to talk to Vahn about?

Vahn

--

You’re interested to hear more about Vahn, so you ask him about himself.

The blonde half ausar crosses his arms, his fluffy tail swishing about. “... Me? I’m not that interesting. I mean, young, strapping half-ausar tech heads like me are a credit a dozen. My story doesn’t even hold a candle to yours, Ms. heir-to-a-galactic-business-empire.”

Not one to let up, you pester Vahn until he caves. “... Oh, all right. Where to start? Uh... I guess with my name - Vahn Arcon Desai. Only fair I give you mine, since everyone knows yours. I work for Steele Tech as a senior ship technician, so I spend a lot of my days fixing up mining vessels that dock at Tavros.”

Still, working for Steele Tech as a senior technician is fairly impressive, especially since Vahn looks fairly young. You state as much and he bashfully scratches one of his canine ears.

“Well, yeah, I got pretty lucky - scored myself a scholarship to Ausaril Tech funded by your dad’s company. I heard he had an honorary doctorate there? Anyway, I studied Applied Mechanics, since I love tinkering with my hands,” Vahn brushes back his hair, “...When I graduated, I was scooped up immediately by Steele Tech, since, you know, they’re always looking for folks who are good with gadgets.”

“That’s pretty much how I wound up here. I’m not sure if that answered your question, though, since I do have a life outside of work!”

--

What would you like to talk to Vahn about?

Hobbies

--

You ask Vahn about his hobbies. The friendly half-ausar seems happy to discuss them with you.

“My hobbies? Vehicle restoration’s a biggie; I’ve got two vintage hovercars I bought for a steal and I’m doing them up,” Vahn explains, “One is a Atlas Dynamus, a beautiful old twin-seater with an old quad-levi axel. It was really big during the last rush. The other one is a Lexi Fusion that I’m missing half the parts for; I’m hand machining half of them myself since I can’t find a seller.”

There’s a distinct gleam in the blond tech’s eyes and his bushy tail is waggling. It’s pretty obvious Vahn loves talking about his toys!

“Um, what else? Oh - I also love playing graviball. There’s a court on the station and I play twice a week. We’re not the best team, but we’re in the top three. I play point guard. I’ve started playing back when I was at Ausaril Tech and I’ve kept with it since then.”

“Other than that, I usually like going out with the crew, having a few drinks and playing a few rounds of billiards. If I’m lucky, usually the night ends with me sinking one in a nice, tight pocket.”

--

What would you like to talk to Vahn about?

Back

--

You walk up to Vahn. He’s standing in the hangar next to your ship, checking over its condition. When you walk up, he stops what he’s doing and shoots you a cheery smile. His canine ears are perked and his tail is swishing side to side.

“Hey there, Captain Steele! What can I do you for?”

Leave

--

A sprawling, brightly lit hangar greets your eyes, empty save for a single ship near the back. Your gaze is pulled away from the distant craft by the sheer size of the enclosure. A hangar like this must have cost your father a veritable fortune to buy out - not much considering how wealthy he was, but no insignificant chunk of change. Magnetically-bounded plasma shields hold in the atmosphere while remaining transparent enough for you to view the nearby warp gate and inky blackness beyond. Perhaps the only thing this place couldn’t hold would be a capital ship, but a number of moorings with connective umbilicals stand by to tether one outside in that extreme scenario.

Vahn’s around here somewhere, if you want to look for him.

Enter Ship

--

The inside of your father’s old Casstech Z14 is in remarkably great shape for such an old ship; the mechanics that were working on this really ought to be proud of themselves. Seats for two lie in the cockpit, and there is a servicable but small shower near the back. Three bunks are scattered around the cramped interior, providing barely adequate room for you and your crew.

Fly

--

Where do you want to go?

Mhen’ga

--

You fly to Mhen’ga and step out of your ship.

--

Though dubbed a hangar, this suspended platform is little more than an exposed landing pad. It’s a hexagonal, steelcrete plate, one of dozens that ring the central elevator spire. Blinking lights ring the edges to guide you when taking off or landing, and to keep other ships from clipping the platform when seeking their own. An elevator door hangs open to the south, waiting for you to press the button that will take you back to the ground, while your ship remains parked here, ready to be entered.

[SAVES]

Though dubbed a hangar, this suspended platform is little more than an exposed landing pad. It’s a hexagonal, steelcrete plate, one of dozens that ring the central elevator spire. Blinking lights ring the edges to guide you when taking off or landing, and to keep other ships from clipping the platform when seeking their own. An elevator door hangs open to the south, waiting for you to press the button that will take you back to the ground, while your ship remains parked here, ready to be entered.

Down

--

A standard self-assembling cargo elevator towers overhead, connected to dozens of landing pads covered with brilliantly flashing lights. The supporting girders are stamped with the logo of Pyrite Heavy Industries, the subgroup of Pyrite Industries that handles the largest constructions. The whole thing still gleams like new, even in an environment so damp that the metal is sweating drops of condensation. The doors to the elevator are open; all you need to do is push the button to go back to your ship. Fences and the wall of a building to the east keep you penned in this area, but a doorway marked “Customs” to the east could be entered if you wish to explore.

East

--

This office is one of many set up around the spaceport to process customs both coming and going. Other identical rooms can be spotted through doorways to the north, but they appear to be closed down or currently occupied. A single, large desk sits on the east side of the room, kept fairly tidy aside from a mug filled with lollipops and candy. A name placard proclaims the desk’s owner to be Flahne. A doorway to the west opens out back into the jungle at the base of an elevator. The door to the south is labelled ‘Out to Esbeth.'

Some kind of amber, gel-like material in the shape of a woman is sitting behind the desk, fiddling with paperwork. Upon seeing you, she withdraws the remains of a sucker from her mouth, tosses it in a waste bin full of similar candied sticks, and says, “Hi there! I just need you to fill out some paperwork about your business on planet!”

A rickety-looking chair is the only available seating, so you sit down on it as gingerly as possible. The gel-woman extends her hand in greeting, and you take it, introducing yourself.

She smiles back, “Call me Flahne. I’m the official U.G.C. contact here in Esbeth and on Mhen’ga as a whole. It’s a thankless job, but somebody has to keep all the paperwork straight until we can smooth over relations with the natives and get a real civilization going here.”

You spend much of the time marvelling at the gelatinous woman’s appearance. Her hair is the same honeyed color as the rest of her, and it isn’t even real hair - just transparent, amber gel done up in a stylish bun that perches atop shoulder-length tresses. Two long ears protrude from the sides of her head, each about as wide as her face and narrowing to points at the tips. Her eyes are a stunning, mischievous violet. One glaring absence is the lack of a nose under them; she has no olfactory organ whatsoever, unless it is hidden elsewhere on her person. The pouting lips help to draw your eye away, and you can’t help but glance lower into the barely-concealed cleavage her half-buttoned top is struggling to contain. The elastic white fabric just doesn’t seem up to containing what must be G-cups.

“Ahem.” Flahne clears her throat with a twinkle in her eyes. “These are pretty standard forms. You can fill them out on the workstation over there or your computing device of choice.”

You nod and produce your codex, busily filling out forms as Flahne makes small talk. Seeing the odd looks you give her, she explains that she is a rahn, specifically a loo’rahn, as determined by her coloration. Numerous interruptions dot the conversation as she consumes stick after stick of candy, sucking long and hard on each and then resuming her instructions as if she had never paused at all. Flahne apparently has a monstrous sweet tooth.

“Once you’ve finished up, just go ahead and transfer the files over,” the gracious, soft-looking secretary bubbles. At that, you realize that you are finished and press the send button; the codex actually has tactile screen deformation to give the buttons an edge you can feel, not at all like those cheap touchscreens you find everywhere for a few credits. “Oh, absolutely perfect! You’ve got a head for this stuff, sugar.” She chews on the candy as she looks over the forms, and a long prehensile tongue dangles out of her mouth, curling around the stick to hold it while she types away at an ancient-looking keyboard.

Flahne’s computer chimes merrily, and she announces, “All done! Now, since you’re such a cutie, I’d like to tell you to watch out if you go outside of town. A fair portion of the natives here are aggressive and more than a little sexually active... if you catch my meaning. I’d hate to see someone as pretty as you go out and get accosted by those devilish zil!” she shudders. “Besides, if you’re going to have a little fun with anyone, it ought to be someone nice and soft.”

Your codex quietly displays a message that the available information on the rahn race has been aggregated.

Talk

--

Flahne seems genuinely excited to talk to you again. “So, what did you want to talk about, Miss Steele? God, I love that name. It sounds so... firm.” She blushes and continues, “Sorry, maybe I ought to stick to calling you cutie, since you are... what did you want to talk about?”

The Locals

--

You ask her if she could tell you a little bit more about the locals.

Flahne brushes a strand of floppy, gelatinous hair to the side and says, “First off, there are the zil. They’re pretty much the only form of intelligent life out there worth talking to in my opinion. Unfortunately, they’re pretty tribal and in their culture, when they meet someone from another tribe out in the jungle, it’s traditional for them to fight for dominance and fuck. Male or female, they don’t really care. To them it isn’t really that bad of a thing, just a way to decide who’s on top. From what I’ve heard they both usually walk away smiling. The loser almost always gives up before they get hurt too bad.”

“Why is that?” you ask curiously.

Flahne giggles, “That’s the best part! They’ve got super potent pheromones they can release at will. I’m told that smelling them turns you on like crazy and makes you just want to fuck them in whatever way they prefer.” Her lips color orange with nervousness. “I hope you won’t tell anybody about me cussing like that; I’m not supposed to on the job.”

You idly wonder if she’s supposed to be flirting either, but dismiss it as she prattles on.

“So, they look kinda like wasps with all the chitin covering them, but they pull it back and they have the cutest cocks... at least the men do, anyways. The girls have these juicy-looking snatches and breasts that can drip honey. I’ve been hoping a pretty, civilized one would come through, but then I met you! You’re so cute that those silly bugs don’t stand a chance. So far, a few of the males have come into town to try and drive us off. Penny disabled two of them pretty easily before the others ran off. I gotta admit, I started dripping when their combined smells wafted over here,” the curvy woman says while wiggling uncomfortably in her chair.

Tossing a spent sucker into her waste bin, she grabs a new one and plops it between her plump lips, sucking noisily in between sentences. “I think they’re in jail ‘til Penny figures out what to do with ‘em. She installed some remote auto-turrets afterward. All it’ll take is a call to her and they’ll light up any nasties she tags.”

Sentry turrets? Talk about overkill. Is there something worse out there?

Flahne nonchalantly pops out her sucker and says, “Oh no. All things considered, Mhen’ga is a pretty nice planet. The worst we have are cunt snakes, and some infested asshole brought those in from offworld. We still haven’t gotten a decent body scanner in yet, so now we’ve got parasitic snakes out there, adapting to the planet. They’ll probably have acclimated fully before we can get any decent gas treatments for them in.” Flahne sighs. “They’re kind of gross, I think. I mean, they’ve got lust-inducing venom that they use to incapacitate their victims – usually males – and then they’ll use the vagina they’ve got on their other end to feed. Girls usually get left alone. Sometimes, if they take a liking to their victim, they’ll wait until she’s asleep and then bite into the base of the spine. They do some kind of crazy metamorphosis and meld into the victim’s body, so when they wake up, they’ve got a pussy tail with a powerful thirst for cum.”

You shiver at the odd mental picture.

“Yeah, they only eat the cum. They actually have dozens of species worth of DNA stored inside them and use the biology of their host to determine the most appropriate mutations to impose upon their young. It’s really quite clever, even if they are little more than dumb snakes that eventually turn into unthinking, tail-based breeding machines. They aren’t even from here, so you can’t blame the jungle for them!” Flahne says, with a note of pride in her voice.

You ask if she’s attached to this planet.

The amber woman nods. “You bet I am! I’ve been here since the planet was declared colonist-ready and the first buildings were raised. It’s a tough planet, but a sweet one.” She sucks on her candy. “We just go together so well!”

You laugh at Flahne’s weak joke, then ask if there’s anything else out there.

Her expression darkens. “Yeah, there are the venus pitchers, too. We don’t have to worry about them in town; they only grow in the darkest, most lightless parts of the jungle. They’re plants, but they’re as sentient as you or me. They just don’t have interest in anything that isn’t extracting fluids from their prey.” Flahne mouths a single word: ‘lazy’. It’s cute, but surprisingly difficult to make out coming from orange lips on a yellow face. “So they just stand there with these hidden, subterranean pods below. That’s where all their tentacles are. And they look like these sexy, curvy women to lure in zil or whoever else wanders out there. When someone gets too close, they fall into the pod or get pulled in, and then they’re forced to cum for hours until they’re damn near dry. At that point, the pitchers toss them out and close up, sealing themselves off until they’re hungry again.”

“Why don’t they just eat the person?”

Flahne taps her chin in thought. “You know... I never really thought about that. Some people that have... ‘met’ them say that they dream of being inside the pods afterward. Most of the people that spoke up about that aren’t around anymore. I guess the jungle claimed them?”

The gluttonous gel doesn’t seem that sure of the last point. “Not much else to say about it, really. Anything else I can help you with, Miss Steele?”

--

Flahne seems genuinely excited to talk to you again. “So, what did you want to talk about, Miss Steele? God, I love that name. It sounds so... firm.” She blushes and continues, “Sorry, maybe I ought to stick to calling you cutie, since you are... what did you want to talk about?”

Her Race

--

Flahne perks up at that. She’s obviously pleased at the chance to talk about her people and launches straight into a little lecture. “Well, it’s understandable that you’d be curious. As I said earlier, I’m a rahn. A lot of people call us gel-girls for, well... obvious reasons.” She pokes at her chest, sinking her finger a few inches into the fluffy boob without issue. When she pulls away, the divot slowly springs back into shape. “Most of us don’t mind. I mean, I used to call humans ‘spinelings’ when I was young and sheltered. Boy, did that ever cause me trouble!” Flahne pops her sucker back in her mouth for a moment and takes a few long licks on it. “Anyway, I know better now. As a matter of fact, I can recite the proper names of most galactic races from memory.” She beams at that.

The curvy secretary pulls the half-dissolved remains of her lollipop out and tosses it aside, unwrapping a fresh one as she gets back on track, “We got discovered in the last planet rush. We were barely tribal back then I’m told, simple predators hunting the smaller beasts of our world.” Flahne makes a mock, scary face at you and growls, a sound that reminds you more of a bubbling brook than a fierce predator.

You both break into giggles at that. “It seems so silly in hindsight. Somebody saw some potential in us and helped us adapt to technology instead of living like savages. I wish I knew who, I’d like to give them a big ol’ hug!” Flahne sighs dreamily until you prod her to finish. “Oh, right... so we got full acceptance into the U.G.C. about thirty standard years back, and ever since, we’ve been trying to do right by the galaxy as a whole. Our intelligence is right around the galactic standard, we don’t need much to eat, and we’re pretty darn tough to kill. Not to mention that we’re sociable and less inclined to violence than most carbon-based lifeforms.”

Flahne seems very proud of that last statement, even puffing her chest out a bit and straightening her posture, which of course makes her breasts bounce. She even adds, “We’re pretty good about breeding, too. It’s really easy for us to control whether we actually reproduce or not, so overpopulation is something we’ve never had a problem with. Of course, cum is way better-tasting than meat, so we tend to eat that in whatever hole we can get it in now.” Flahne licks her lips without meaning to as her expression saddens. “Some people have started treating us like brainless sluts, just because we prefer our meals to come from our friends and get turned on easily, but unlike other species, getting horny doesn’t impact our cognitive abilities much. If I didn’t care to make my partners squirt out as much yummy jizz as possible, I could probably get a lot of work done at the same time.”

The curvy gel-woman smiles a little lewdly at you. “I hope that doesn’t bother you. We rahn aren’t very modest by nature, and sexuality is just another source of pleasure and food for us.” She sucks on her lolly and admits, “I tend to be a rather hungry woman.”

Flahne seems genuinely excited to talk to you again. “So, what did you want to talk about, Miss Steele? God, I love that name. It sounds so... firm.” She blushes and continues, “Sorry, maybe I ought to stick to calling you cutie, since you are... what did you want to talk about?”


Her Subrace

--

You mention that you’d like to know more about her subspecies in particular.

Flahne lights up with delight as you broach that topic. “Well, you know about the rahn, so I guess I could explain a bit about what it means to be a loo’rahn.” She smiles up at you and peels back one of the sleeves on her button-down shirt, exposing the honeyed flesh beneath. “As you can see, I’m semi-transparent, like all rahn, but I’m yellowish in color. Rahn almost always produce the same color offspring, unless it is a pairing of two different colored rahn. Our colorization forms in response to our characteristics, with each color having different advantages.”

Rolling her sleeve back down, Flahne continues, “Loo’rahn tend to be less durable than the other types, but we make up for it in other ways. Our tongues are longer and more nimble. We can be even softer than our sisters, who are already far more plush than a human girl could ever be.” She gingerly pushes her hand into the heaving curve of her breast, slowly depressing it until she’s swallowed up to the wrist in boobflesh. “An upside of this is that we can reshape our bodies more easily than other rahn in order to assume new shapes or forms. It still takes a good while, but it can have its advantages.”

You nod, easily seeing how the ability to alter one’s form could have immense uses, even if you couldn’t change the color of your body.

“It does have its downsides. It’s hard to keep all the excess nutrition I hold inside myself from settling into unattractive areas. I really should cut down on the sugar, but it’s just so good! It tastes even better in my cum, too, so I just keep drinking it and never really lose it.” Flahne stands up out of her seat and pivots around, showing just how thick and juicy her hips and bosom truly are. “It’s good to have this much control over my body, huh?”

Flahne settles down, her soft bottom lewdly squishing and stretching at the hem of her skirt when her thick thighs compress. She looks up with a proud smile, and admits, “Don’t get me wrong, some of the other rahn have some pretty great things that they can do. Red rahn can secrete all kinds of disabling chemicals on their surface. White ones are super efficient at absorbing nutrients, but that means they have more leftovers to let out. They leak like faucets when they masturbate or get too turned on. The green and blue ones are mega tough. I’ve seen one of those turn their skin hard enough to stop a bullet.” She seems a little out of breath after rattling all that off. Settling down for a moment to lick at her candy gives her a second to settle down.

“I guess that’s it,” she says at last, “but I’d be happy to talk about my people as much as you like.”

[SAVES]

--

This office is one of many set up around the spaceport to process customs both coming and going. Other identical rooms can be spotted through doorways to the north, but they appear to be closed down or currently occupied. A single, large desk sits on the east side of the room, kept fairly tidy aside from a mug filled with lollipops and candy. A name placard proclaims the desk’s owner to be Flahne. A doorway to the west opens out back into the jungle at the base of an elevator. The door to the south is labelled ‘Out to Esbeth.'

Flahne looks up at you with a smile on her juicy, amber lips. “Well, what can I do for you today, Miss Steele?” Her big, bouncy breasts are straining her top as hard as ever, though the way she has almost half the buttons undone isn’t helping.

What do you do with the curvy rahn secretary?

Sex Options

--

Making love to a curvy, eager woman wouldn’t be so bad. With a disarming smile, you ask her if she knows any. She frowns in thought for a moment before she catches on to the joke.

“Oh, you’re blind? You didn’t mark that on your paperwork.”

The full-bodied secretary giggles, a high-pitched, bubbly sound. “If that’s the case, we can have some fun.” The last word is said with such sultry delight that it’s practically purred. She opens a button, causing her mountainous melons to visibly quake and jostle against each other when she leans toward you.

“So... how do you want it?” Flahne asks as her top compresses against the desk, hinting at her intentions.

Swap Oral

--

With the gel-like secretary’s truly impressive rack suddenly on almost-complete display, it takes you a moment to churn through your options. After seeing her long, writhing tongue play around the candies the secretary’s always sucking on, you can’t wait to see what it could do to your virginal, human cunt. Then again, those huge tits of hers are swaying hypnotically in your face, making you think of all the things you could do to a rack like that...

“Cat got your tongue, cutie?” Flahne teases. As she speaks, though, the amber-hued secretary hops up from her swivel chair and slips around to your side of her desk, working through the remaining buttons of her shirt until it slips off her shoulders completely.

You nod at her question, completely entranced by the hypnotic sway of her huge tits, and the suggestive sashay of her wide hips underneath her skirt. “Well, ask your kitty friend if I can borrow it for a while,” she coos, hefting herself up onto the edge of the desk and spreading her legs. You’re not surprised to see she’s not wearing any panties under that sinfully short bottom of hers, and your eyes are instantly drawn to the glistening, golden honeypot tucked between her thick thighs.

She gives you a look with a mischievous glint in her amethyst eyes and pats her thighs invitingly, a silent offer for you to dig in. As her hands impact her alien flesh, her whole lower body seems to tremble with the shock, reacting just like gelatin and quaking in ways that send the most awe-inspiring shockwaves all the way to her pendulous breasts.

You don’t have to be asked twice.

You slink down onto your knees, putting your face right on level with the jiggling gel’s huge tits. From there, it’s just a little bit of leaning to nestle yourself between her meaty legs, close enough to smell the sugary musk wafting up from the slit of Flahne’s sex. You’d almost think the curvaceous gel-girl was made of sweets!

Eager to see if Flahne’s pussy tastes as good as it smells, you flick your tongue out along one of her outer lips, running it from the bottom of her twat to the hood of her clit. The taste is intoxicating, like the sweetest, sugariest candy you’ve ever eaten in the form of a molten liquid that’s the perfect balance between sticky and creamy. You eat it up, letting the sweet stuff spur you on to licking deeper and faster into the giggling rahn’s cunt.

“Ooh, that’s the spot!” she purrs, digging her soft digits into the lip of her desk and moaning with pleasure. Her hips wiggle happily, sending quaking sways through her huge tits - the sight of them going wild is too much to bear, and you find yourself reaching up to grab the massive mounds. Your fingers sink into them, all but vanishing into the soft gold gel that makes up Flahne’s bust. Flahne giggles and shakes her shoulders, making you cling hard to her tits or be shaken off. The harder you squeeze, the more she moans - and the more of her sweet nectar you’re able to lick out of her drooling cunt.

With a bit of pressure, your tongue’s able to peel her pussylips apart, gaining access to the perfectly-formed passage between them. “Oh, oh gosh,” Flahne murmurs as your tongue squirms its way ever so slowly into her, spreading her soft, sodden slit nice and wide. “Eat it up, sugar. Eat it all up!”

You’d laugh at the corny pillow-talk if you weren’t chin-deep in alien pussy. As it stands, you eagerly follow your giggly lover’s instruction, licking your way around her cunny’s walls and lapping up all her sweet juices. You can tell she’s getting close now! You lick and squeeze more fiercely, driving Flahne’s pleasure ever higher until she lets out a sharp gasp, and you feel her thighs clench around your face. A thick squirt of her candy-like juices presages an orgasm that has you fighting to catch your breath between wet surges and Flahne trying to bury you between her thick, soft thighs - a demise you honestly can’t say you’d be opposed to, if it feels anywhere near as nice as her skin does against yours, rubbing wetly but softly all over you.

Finally, you manage to break away from Flahne’s death-grip and catch your breath. Without anything to cling to, the amber rahn flops onto her back and lets out a huge sigh. She looks utterly sated, eyes fluttering closed and hands massaging her well-eaten pussy.

“Oh, I needed that, sweetheart,” Flahne coos, slowly forcing herself to prop up on her arms. “Aww, you look so flustered you’re about to burst! Why don’t you just turn around and let me return the favor, sugar?”

Now that’s an offer you can’t refuse! At a word from Flahne, you turn around and bend over, shaking your fair ass at her and bracing your arms on your legs, your unclaimed, terran cunt on full display for her.

Slowly but surely, her fingers work their way in towards your pussy. You shiver in anticipation, clawing one of your legs along the floor as your lover draws ever closer to your cunt.

You hear Flahne giggling behind you, punctuated by the feeling of one of her smooth, gel-like digits circling your clit. You gasp, and again when her long, probe-like tongue flanks your pleasure-buzzer, lapping across the bud while her fingers teases back the hood. You have to admit, you want to feel that writhing tongue of hers inside you.

Wiggling your noticeable thighs to get Flahne’s attention, you reach back and spank your ass enticingly. She makes you wait an agonizingly long moment, long enough to plant a wet kiss on your clitty before she moves her tongue down to your hole. She moves with easy confidence, using her fingers to spread your pussy lips nice and wide to give herself easy access to your pink slit. It feels like a tentacle sliding into you. Your whole body goes rigid in response, every hair standing on-end as the alien appendage squirms and writhes inside you. Gasping and panting, you grab the far wall for support and try to hold on for dear life - or at least, try not to scream under the alien sensations crawling through you.

Flahne’s tongue can do incredible things, you’re quick to find out. Long and sinuous and dexterous, her writhing amber appendage seems to hone in on every sensitive spot you’ve got until you’re moaning and trembling, struggling to stay on your feet. Your tailstwist and curl behind you, spasming in reaction to shockwaves of pleasure - all the while trying to pull Flahne closer and deeper into your cunt. You buck your noticeable hips back against her smooth face, grinding and humping to trying to fuck Flahne’s tongue deeper into your tight, wet twat.

“Gonna... gonna...” you moan, fingers scrabbling against the wall. Flahne answers with her fingers suddenly back around your clit, massaging your buzzer in time with her tongue’s ministrations. That’s just the push you need to slide over the edge, hurling you into the throes of pleasure. Your cunt squeezes hard around Flahne’s tongue, squirting thick rivulets of girl-cum across Flahne’s cheeks. You can’t help but cry out now, no matter how hard you try not to: a booming moan of pleasure that you’re sure anyone outside Flahne’s office can hear as clear as day. Nothing can stifle you once the dam’s been broken, and you’re moaning like a bitch in heat as Flahne licks and massages you through your climax.

A moment passes, and you all but fall onto your knees when Flahne’s tongue slithers out of you. You spend a moment catching your breath, trembling with the aftershocks of your orgasm. Flahne giggles and licks her lips, murmuring “Now that was a treat!” and looking around for wherever her shirt fell.

As soon as your legs are steady again, you get up and grab your dress clothes, plain bra, and plain panties, grinning at the amber gel-girl. She blows you a kiss between licking your juices off her cheeks.

This office is one of many set up around the spaceport to process customs both coming and going. Other identical rooms can be spotted through doorways to the north, but they appear to be closed down or currently occupied. A single, large desk sits on the east side of the room, kept fairly tidy aside from a mug filled with lollipops and candy. A name placard proclaims the desk’s owner to be Flahne. A doorway to the west opens out back into the jungle at the base of an elevator. The door to the south is labelled ‘Out to Esbeth.'

Flahne’s honey-colored skin blushes orange at your approach, and she asks, “Hey there cutie, come back for a little more sugar? I could use a snack.” Her tongue snakes out to lick her lips before curling around her sucker and slowly pumping it in and out of her mouth. She leans down over her desk, pressing her big, soft breasts against the table so that they strain at the side seams of her shirt. “Or did you just want a peep?”

The curvy rahn seems happy with either option, though you could probably just talk too. What did you want to do with Flahne? You aren’t aroused enough for sex with her right now.

Talk

--

Flahne seems a little saddened that you aren’t interested in debauchery at the moment, but she closes one of her buttons for you. “So, what did you want to talk about, Miss Steele? God, I love that name. It sounds so... firm.” She blushes and continues, “Sorry, maybe I ought to stick to calling you cutie, since you are... what did you want to talk about?”

Her Race

--

Flahne perks up at that. She’s obviously pleased at the chance to talk about her people and launches straight into a little lecture. “Well, it’s understandable that you’d be curious. As I said earlier, I’m a rahn. A lot of people call us gel-girls for, well... obvious reasons.” She pokes at her chest, sinking her finger a few inches into the fluffy boob without issue. When she pulls away, the divot slowly springs back into shape. “Most of us don’t mind. I mean, I used to call humans ‘spinelings’ when I was young and sheltered. Boy, did that ever cause me trouble!” Flahne pops her sucker back in her mouth for a moment and takes a few long licks on it. “Anyway, I know better now. As a matter of fact, I can recite the proper names of most galactic races from memory.” She beams at that.

The curvy secretary pulls the half-dissolved remains of her lollipop out and tosses it aside, unwrapping a fresh one as she gets back on track, “We got discovered in the last planet rush. We were barely tribal back then I’m told, simple predators hunting the smaller beasts of our world.” Flahne makes a mock, scary face at you and growls, a sound that reminds you more of a bubbling brook than a fierce predator.

You both break into giggles at that. “It seems so silly in hindsight. Somebody saw some potential in us and helped us adapt to technology instead of living like savages. I wish I knew who, I’d like to give them a big ol’ hug!” Flahne sighs dreamily until you prod her to finish. “Oh, right... so we got full acceptance into the U.G.C. about thirty standard years back, and ever since, we’ve been trying to do right by the galaxy as a whole. Our intelligence is right around the galactic standard, we don’t need much to eat, and we’re pretty darn tough to kill. Not to mention that we’re sociable and less inclined to violence than most carbon-based lifeforms.”

Flahne seems very proud of that last statement, even puffing her chest out a bit and straightening her posture, which of course makes her breasts bounce. She even adds, “We’re pretty good about breeding, too. It’s really easy for us to control whether we actually reproduce or not, so overpopulation is something we’ve never had a problem with. Of course, cum is way better-tasting than meat, so we tend to eat that in whatever hole we can get it in now.” Flahne licks her lips without meaning to as her expression saddens. “Some people have started treating us like brainless sluts, just because we prefer our meals to come from our friends and get turned on easily, but unlike other species, getting horny doesn’t impact our cognitive abilities much. If I didn’t care to make my partners squirt out as much yummy jizz as possible, I could probably get a lot of work done at the same time.”

The curvy gel-woman smiles at you. “You know I’ve always given you my full attention. Let me know if you want to have any fun, by the way.”

You playfully thank her for the offer, informing her that you want to know more before you get down.

Flahne appears very nervous as she goes back into discussing her race’s sexuality, but she pushes ahead regardless, “My favorite part about my race is our... well, ovipositors.” She looks meaningfully at you. “Our dicks, to oversimplify it. Well, not really dicks, but they kind of look like human penises, only we lay eggs through them into our partners when we want to have kids.”

Your thoughts are evidently written across your face; Flahne smirks mirthfully at you.

“It doesn’t hurt at all! Our outer membranes are very strong but very elastic, allowing us such delightfully stretchiness. We can even slowly reshape our bodies into the shape we wish to have.” The rahn smiles and rushes through the rest, “Most of us only really have them come out when we’ve got fertilized eggs we want to lay in someone, but we can usually control it. Personally, I really like mine and learned how to make it come out even when I’m not ready to lay.” She looks at you meaningfully and follows up, “I can also make it stay in all the time too. It’s just that once it slips out, I can’t really get it to go away without...” She makes an up-and-down stroking motion with her hand.

“Would me letting it out bother you?”

Let It Out

--

Flahne sighs rather comfortably after noticing that the room is empty and flips back her skirt to show you the big, chubby girl-boner she’s grown. “Our ovipositors are my favorite part about us. I even grew mine to be extra big, so there’d be more to stroke. I guess all the sweets I eat have made it so that my cum and lubricants are as sweet as candy. That’s another good reason for making it big right there.” Flahne traces a finger across the top of it, sighing and shuddering from the pleasure with such enthusiasm that ripples run from her thick thighs all the way to her enormous tits. A dollop of whitish cream forms atop the wobbling prick’s peak, and she scoops it up on her finger, swallowing it before you can react. She smooths her skirt back into place a moment later, accompanied by a full-body orange blush.

“Not much more to tell, really. We grow up quick, so if I were to have you bear my children, they’d be able to care for themselves in short order.” Flahne says with one last smile, “I’m glad you take interest in me for more than just the sex. It’s refreshing.”

--

Flahne seems a little saddened that you aren’t interested in debauchery at the moment, but she closes one of her buttons and tries to ignore the bulge in her skirt for you. “So, what did you want to talk about, Miss Steele? God, I love that name. It sounds so... firm.” She blushes and continues, “Sorry, maybe I ought to stick to calling you cutie, since you are... what did you want to talk about?”

Ovipositor

--

You mention her ovipositor, currently dangling free whenever the mood strikes her.

“Well, what do you want to know about it?” Flahne asks coyly.

About It

-

You tell her that you actually wanted to hear about her ovipositor - how does it work?

Flahne smiles cheekily and asks, “A little curious, Miss Steele?” She winks. “You’ve already seen it, but I’d be happy to give you a closer look.”

You stare blankly at her, waiting for her to get back on-topic.

Flahne harrumphs at your lack of response. “Okay, okay. I told you earlier that we lay eggs through them, but that’s not all they’re good for. When we orgasm or give birth, lots of whitish lubricants come out with it, like what you might call cum.” Flahne smiles again. “I kind of like to call it cum, too, even though mine is as sweet as candy.”

“Why is that?” you ask.

Plopping her sucker back into her mouth, the gel-woman explains in between licks, “Well, when we have too much mass, we secrete it as sexual fluids. It’s kind of useful - if one of us is eating really well, we can share the nutrition with our friends that way. I eat so much candy that I’m pretty much filled to the brim with sugary goodness, even though we don’t really use it for anything.” Flahne tilts her head to the side and whispers one last bit, “Since it tastes so good and I like my ovipositor so much, I usually eat it right up, which is why I’m so much more voluptuous than most rahn.”

Your sugared companion continues. “ I’m all for accepting people for who they are, but I understand how it’s possible to like everything about a person except for one thing. That’s why I don’t mind keeping it tucked away for cute girls like you, if you want. In a nutshell, most of us just use it for laying eggs, but it makes a pretty damned good stand-in for a cock. I’ve never had any complaints from any of the ladies brave enough to sit in my lap, anyway.”

She must see the look on your face, because she colors orangish and quietly says, “Well, a few walked kind of funny and were rather sore... still, they didn’t complain! Not seriously, anyway.” Flahne twirls her lollipop in her mouth as she racks her brain - or whatever rahn use to think - for more information. “I nearly forgot! Some of us grow them above our clits, and some of us grow them from our clits. Mine grows out of my clit, so it’s extra sensitive!” she proudly declares.

Well, that explains why she’s so enamored of it.

“Annnnnnd, that’s it! Nothing else to say about it unless you want to inspect it personally, which you already declined,” Flahne says. “So, anything else you want me to do with it?”

--

You mention her ovipositor, currently dangling free whenever the mood strikes her.

“Well, what do you want to know about it?” Flahne asks coyly.
