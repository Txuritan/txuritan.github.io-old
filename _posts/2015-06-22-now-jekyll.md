It took for ever to do so but I converted my site over to Jekyll so updating and adding new pages with be much easier. This also means that the website will be updated a lot as I try to fix the mistakes.

Whats better is that since I'm using Markdown to write posts I'll be able to add code blocks like this one.

```
Code Block
```

It even has syntax highlighting so you'll know the difference between Java and C#. Because of the new addition of code blocks I might start a guide on how to code Minecraft mods or something I'm not quite sure yet.
