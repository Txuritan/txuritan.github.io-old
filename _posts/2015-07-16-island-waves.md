I've currently been using the [Solarus Engine](http://www.solarus-games.org/), the Solarus Engine is an opensource ActionRPG engine that allows you to make The Legend of Zelda style games, to make [Island Waves](http://txuritan.github.io/island-waves/). I thought of the base idea after I saw the movie [Max](http://max-themovie.com/) with my cousin and one of our friends, I'll post more on the plot of Island Waves later. Now the only downside to Solarus is the the quest builder uses LUA scripting and I don't know LUA script, I've tried my hand at it while using the tutorial on creating a Garrys Mod hud which didn't work even though I copied it work for word.

Now about the browser, I'll be using either Mozilla's [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko) or Google's [Blink](http://www.chromium.org/blink). This browser will replace [NekoWB](https://github.com/Txuritan/NekoWB), my Java based web browser using a edition of [Webkit](https://www.webkit.org/) made for Java.

I have also been reading [Finding Why's](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5934267/1/Finding-Why-s) by [B. A. Ware](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2289309/B-A-Ware) which has given me an idea to add to Island Waves, if any of you have read it you'll know just what I'll add.
